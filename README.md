Jobify seeks to leverage the prevalent gig economy to provide users with a quick and easy solution to their everday tasks. Users can post a variety of jobs to Jobify's job board, and jobbers can view and accept tasks. Both parties receive live updates on the status of the jobs they've either posted or accepted, allowing for simple resolutions of users' day-to-day needs.
